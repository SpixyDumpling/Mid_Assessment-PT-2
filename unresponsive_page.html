                    <h3>Spirits Showcase: Explore the Elixir Universe</h3>

                    <h4><span class="bold">Whiskey</span></h4>
                    <p>A varied and diverse spirit with many different varieties and regional tastes and flavors that go
                        into
                        them. At its core, whiskey is a distilled grain spirit, typically made from corn, barley, wheat,
                        and
                        rye, which is then aged in wooden barrels.
                        Whiskey is noted for its caramel and vanilla notes and flavors, as well as the woody and warm
                        flavors
                        common in whiskey. There are many different specific types of regional whiskey styles, from
                        bourbon
                        whiskey, rye whiskey, Irish whiskey, Scotch whisky, Japanese whisky, and Tennessee whiskey. Each
                        whiskey
                        is unique in flavor, but common flavor notes across varieties of whiskey are warm, spicy,
                        caramelly,
                        nutty, woody, and toasty.</p>

                    Brandy, like many spirits, gets even better with age. The designation of the style depends on how
                    long
                    the spirit has been aged.</p>
